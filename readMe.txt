For this kata, you will be creating a library which will allow the addition and subtraction of
Roman numerals.

Roman Numeral rules:
  • Roman numerals consist of the following letters: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M which mean one,
    five, ten, fifty, hundred, five hundred and one thousand respectively.
  • As we are in Rome there are no such things as decimals or integers, we need to do this
    with the strings. An example would be "XIV" + "LX" = "LXXIV" ● Numerals can be
    concatenated to form a larger numeral ("XX" + "II" = "XXII")
  • If a lesser numeral is put before a bigger it means subtraction of the lesser from the
    bigger ("IV" means four, "CM" means ninehundred)
  • If the numeral is I, X or C you can't have more than three ("II" + "II" = "IV" not “IIII”)
  • If the numeral is V, L or D you can't have more than one ("D" + "D" = "M" not “DD”)
